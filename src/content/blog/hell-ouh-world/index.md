# Hello, again..

It's me, Alperen. I really don't know how much times I wrote a hello world post.
The last one, was like 2 maybe 3 year ago.
After 3 years with [this domain](https://alperenn.com) and withot landing page or a blog, I wanted to start a blog, again, again, again.

I heard about GatsbyJS and its speed. First, I wanted to make a blog theme for me from scratch. Of course, I didn't. Thanks to RedQ Team, I bought this GatsbyJS Blog Template a week ago. Installed and created auto deploy for this, finally.

So, here we are.
